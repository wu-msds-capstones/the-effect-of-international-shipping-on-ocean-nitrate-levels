# Analysis

Preliminary association (chi-square test). Before clustering, we asked a simple question: are nitrate levels independent of shipping intensity when both are binned? Using the full dataset, shipping density and nitrate were each split into three tertiles (below the 33rd percentile = “Low,” 33rd–66th = “Average,” above the 66th = “High”). We then built a contingency table of shipping category by nitrate category and ran Pearson’s chi-square test of independence. The table (Figure 0) shows clear deviations from independence; the test statistic is χ² ≈ 46,579 with 2 degrees of freedom and p < 0.001, so we reject the null of no association. Given the very large sample, the related Cramér’s V is modest (≈ 0.083). In other words, there is an association, but it is small; this motivates the more detailed, context-aware work that follows.

The goal of clustering is to split the study region into regional groups that make sense for both location and environment. That way, later comparisons are “like with like,” instead of mixing very different ocean settings. We cluster on six variables latitude, longitude, nitrate, distance to the nearest coast (km), chlorophyll-a, and shipping density after standardizing each to z-scores so differences in units and variance don’t let any one feature dominate the Euclidean distance that K-means uses. A small share of rows had missing inputs (often chlorophyll-a at high latitudes); to avoid dropping them, we imputed zeros and then checked plots and maps to make sure this did not create fake separation. Because latitude and longitude are included, the clusters should be read as place and environment groups, not purely chemical groups. This choice makes maps easy to read, but we are careful with casual language later.

We chose the number of clusters by looking for the elbow in the within-cluster sum of squares for k = 2–9. The curve falls quickly through k=4 and then flattens; the elbow is around five. Figure 1 shows this and marks k=5 with a dashed line. Five clusters avoid both extremes: too few would lump shelves, lanes, and gyres; too many would split coherent regions into tiny pieces. With k set to five, we fit K-means and assign the labels back to each observation for mapping and analysis.

Figures 2 and 3 show the spatial structure at two levels. Figure 2 plots all clustered observations in the Atlantic bounding box, colored by label. The narrow streaks across the North Atlantic appear because of how the shipping data were joined to the nitrate data; the nitrate sampling follows that pattern, so when merged, the lines show up. Because overlap can hide boundaries on one composite map, Figure 3 splits the view into five small panels, one per cluster. The footprints then become clear: a shelf group around the UK/Ireland; a broad subtropical belt from the Caribbean to West Africa; a coastal group along the Iberian/Portuguese margins and Bay of Biscay with extensions toward the Channel; a trans-Atlantic corridor around 40–55° N; and a

The distribution of shipping across groups confirms that the algorithm is separating meaningfully different environments, not just carving up space. Figure 4 shows boxplots of shipping density by cluster. The channel node and Iberian-coast group have the highest centers and widest spreads, consistent with busy port approaches and coastal arcs. The trans-Atlantic lane group has a spiky distribution of many near zero cells with very high values along the routes which appear as outliers. The shelf and subtropical groups are mostly low-traffic, though the shelf has occasional spikes near passages. These contrasts justify using the cluster labels as groups for the statistics that follow.

Having stratified the data, we examined whether shipping density is associated with nitrate within each cluster. For each cluster we fit a bivariate ordinary least squares regression of nitrate on log(1 + shipping density), adding a constant term and estimating HC3 robust standard errors to account for heteroskedastic. The log transform compresses extreme density values and renders the slope interpretable as the expected change in nitrate for a one unit change in the transformed density. To aid legibility on the plots, we sampled at most 150,000 points per cluster for the scatter layer while fitting the line to the full set of available observations. Figure 5 (shown in the Results section) displays the five panels with the fitted lines superimposed. The method is intentionally simple: because the clusters already align observations by geography, coastal proximity, and broad productivity context, a within‑cluster trend provides a clean first check for association without yet attributing causality.
Two notes help with interpretation. First, including coordinates ensures spatial coherence but can bias clustering toward geography; standardizing helps, and the maps make the trade-off clear. Second, zero imputation preserves rows but can pull distances toward the origin when data are sparse; distribution checks and the within-cluster approach help reveal artifacts, and we plan robustness checks (e.g., silhouette/Davies–Bouldin in an appendix; median regression and light winsorization) to confirm stability. We therefore treat results here as descriptive and conditional on the group.

Having established a linear baseline, we also fit cluster‑specific random forests to allow for non‑linear and interaction effects between shipping, productivity, distance from land, and geography. Within each cluster we trained a RandomForestRegressor using the feature set log shipping density, chlorophyll‑a, distance to coast, latitude, longitude. Performance was summarized by five‑fold cross‑validated R² and interpretation relied on two complementary diagnostics: permutation importance (mean drop in R² when a feature is shuffled) and partial dependence of nitrate on log‑shipping holding other features at their empirical distribution. Figures 6 and 7 (presented in the Results section) summarize these diagnostics for all five clusters. Because spatial autocorrelation can inflate nominal cross‑validation in geophysical data, we treat R² values as descriptive of in‑sample predictability rather than as out‑of‑sample guarantees; our focus is on the relative importance of features and the shape of the shipping nitrate relationship by cluster.
