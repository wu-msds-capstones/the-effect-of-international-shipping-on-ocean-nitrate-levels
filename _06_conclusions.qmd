# Discussion

While some of the results above suggested possible statistical significance, it is hard to say with certainty whether these results are true, or if they are a product of the variables analyzed. The ocean is a complex system full of moving parts, and many additional variables that were not included have the potential to affect the results of our analysis. Ocean currents, global and local weather patterns, and the lack of uniformity in the chemical composition of the water can affect how and where the nitrogen oxide emissions come into contact and dissolve into the oceans. This would then in turn potentially have an effect on phytoplankton levels. The human impact is also complex, and distilling it down to shipping density and distance from the coastline may be a gross oversimplification. While international shipping accounts for a sizable amount of nitrogen oxide emissions into the atmosphere, it is not the only source. One key limitation of this study is the mismatch between the temporal and spatial resolution of our datasets. Shipping density was derived from aggregated raster imagery, while nitrate measurements are point-based and vary by collection date and depth, which may obscure short-term or fine-scale effects. Additionally, regression results showed low explanatory power, indicating that other factors such as ocean currents, natural upwelling, or atmospheric deposition likely play major roles in nitrate variability. Finally, the best predictor of nitrate concentration being latitude and longitude as a result of random forest feature importance is indicative of our current data missing the main reasons for nitrate variation in the ocean.

# Conclusion

In this study we fail to provide solid evidence that international shipping activity is associated with elevated nitrate levels in the ocean. Our combinations of clustering, chi-square, random forest, and linear regression analyses revealed that while there may be some correlation between shipping density and nitrate levels, shipping density is not the dominant predictor in terms of understanding the nitrate concentration in the ocean. 

Future work could include utilizing sea level atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen oxides to better understand the rate of dissolution. Higher granular temporal and spatial data of the positions of trade ships can be used to show potential changes in ocean chemistry and the resulting impact on marine life.
