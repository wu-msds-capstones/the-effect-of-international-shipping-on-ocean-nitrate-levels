# Abstract

This study examines how major shipping lanes affect the level of nitrate in the water and the effect this has on the phytoplankton levels in the surrounding area. We used data joined by longitude and latitude between the World Ocean Database and shipping density information from the World Bank Group to analyze the relationship between nitrate released from ships and the levels of phytoplankton in the surrounding ocean. We use statistical methods to show whether areas with higher shipping density are significantly different from areas with lower shipping density. In doing so, we found potential small correlation between shipping density and nitrate, but greater correlation between nitrate and coordinate location. These findings suggest that while international shipping may be altering ocean chemistry slightly, there are other larger factors determining ocean nitrate concentration.
