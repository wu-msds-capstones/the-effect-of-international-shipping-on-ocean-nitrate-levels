	abstract = {Marine engines often use diesel as an alternative fuel to improve the economy. In recent years, waste oil, biodiesel and alcohol fuel are the most famous research directions among the alternative fuels for diesel. With the rapid development of the shipping industry, the air of coastal areas is becoming increasingly polluted. It is now necessary to reduce the emission of marine engines to meet the strict emission regulations. There are many types of alternative fuels for diesel oil and the difference of the fuel may interfere with the engine emissions; however, PM, HC, CO and other emissions will have a negative impact on SCR catalyst. This paper reviews the alternative fuels such as alcohols, waste oils, biodiesel made from vegetable oil and animal oil, and then summarizes and analyzes the influence of different alternative fuels on engine emissions and pollutant formation mechanism. In addition, this paper also summarizes the methods that can effectively reduce the emissions of marine engines; it can provide a reference for the study of diesel alternative fuel and the reduction of marine engine emissions.},

	abstract = {Achieving a transition to a near-zero emission shipping requires deploying ships which are powered by low- or zero-carbon alternative fuels. This study delivers a transition plan for the fleet, including the selection of fuel type (among diesel, bio-LNG, bio-methanol and ng-ammonia) for each ship, and determining the number and sizes of ships to add or remove from the fleet in each time period through ship purchasing, chartering and retrofitting, so as to operate the resulting fleet at minimum net cost considering emissions, investment and operating costs and revenues under uncertainty. Results indicate that a single fuel cannot dominate the future. The transition from diesel to bio-methanol is favourable when life-cycle (well-to-wake) emissions are considered, whereas transition from diesel to ng-ammonia dominates when tank-to-wake emissions are considered. In the scenarios where emission costs are high, total emissions are reduced primarily thanks to chartering and retrofitting depending on the ship size.},

	abstract = {Emissions of exhaust gases and particles from oceangoing ships are a significant and growing contributor to the total emissions from the transportation sector. We present an assessment of the contribution of gaseous and particulate emissions from oceangoing shipping to anthropogenic emissions and air quality. We also assess the degradation in human health and climate change created by these emissions. Regulating ship emissions requires comprehensive knowledge of current fuel consumption and emissions, understanding of their impact on atmospheric composition and climate, and projections of potential future evolutions and mitigation options. Nearly 70% of ship emissions occur within 400 km of coastlines, causing air quality problems through the formation of ground-level ozone, sulphur emissions and particulate matter in coastal areas and harbours with heavy traffic. Furthermore, ozone and aerosol precursor emissions as well as their derivative species from ships may be transported in the atmosphere over several hundreds of kilometres, and thus contribute to air quality problems further inland, even though they are emitted at sea. In addition, ship emissions impact climate. Recent studies indicate that the cooling due to altered clouds far outweighs the warming effects from greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or ozone from shipping, overall causing a negative present-day radiative forcing (RF). Current efforts to reduce sulphur and other pollutants from shipping may modify this. However, given the short residence time of sulphate compared to CO2, the climate response from sulphate is of the order decades while that of CO2 is centuries. The climatic trade-off between positive and negative radiative forcing is still a topic of scientific research, but from what is currently known, a simple cancellation of global mean forcing components is potentially inappropriate and a more comprehensive assessment metric is required. The CO2 equivalent emissions using the global temperature change potential (GTP) metric indicate that after 50 years the net global mean effect of current emissions is close to zero through cancellation of warming by CO2 and cooling by sulphate and nitrogen oxides.},

@article{DOMINGUES2011,
	abstract = {Nitrate and ammonium are the most important nitrogen sources for phytoplankton growth. Differential utilization of inorganic nitrogenous compounds by phytoplankton has been observed and may have significant impacts on primary productivity at local scales. We used enrichment experiments with natural phytoplankton populations from the freshwater tidal zone of the Guadiana estuary, a coastal ecosystem increasingly subjected to anthropogenic influences, to study the effects of nitrate and ammonium on N-consumption and phytoplankton growth. In addition, we used combined additions of nitrate and ammonium to understand the inhibitory effect of ammonium over nitrate uptake. Ammonium concentrations in the freshwater tidal reaches of the Guadiana estuary throughout the sampling period were too low to exert an inhibitory effect on nitrate uptake or a toxic effect on phytoplankton growth. Nitrate was clearly the main nitrogen source for phytoplankton at the study site. Overall, nitrate seemed to become limiting at concentrations lower than 20 μM and N-limitation was particularly significant during summer. A trend of decreasing nitrate uptake with increasing ammonium concentrations and uptake suggested an overall preference for ammonium. However, preference for ammonium was group-specific, and it was observed mainly in green algae and cyanobacteria. In fact, cyanobacteria relied only on ammonium as their N-source. On the contrary, diatoms preferred nitrate, and did not respond to ammonium additions. The increasing eutrophication in the Guadiana estuary and particularly increased inputs of nitrogen as ammonium due to urban waste effluents may result in a shift in phytoplankton community composition, towards a dominance of cyanobacteria and green algae.},

	abstract = {A series of size-fractionation experiments was carried out in coastal waters around Georges Bank and in the oligotrophic NW Atlantic to assess the relative importance of picoplankton (< 1 µm) to community nitrogen utilization and to determine if there is a partitioning of the form of nitrogen used (NO3− or NH4+) based on organism size. Results indicate that picoplankton nitrogen uptake was substantial in coastal and oceanic waters, averaging >30\% of the combined nitrate and ammonium uptake by the intact communities; the picoplankton portion of total community N uptake increased offshore. Of the summed nitrate and ammonium used across all sizes, ammonium was favored disproportionately by the picoplankton fraction. On average, however, the differences in preference for nitrogen form were relatively small. The size partitioning of photosynthetic activity and nitrogen uptake was similar.},
